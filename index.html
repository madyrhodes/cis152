    <p>My favorite beverage is water. Water is my favorite beverage because it is hydrating. Water is essential for all of our bodily functions. It helps all of our internal organs do their jobs to keep us healthy. Drinking enough water can also help to keep our skin looking clear and healthy. Everything we eat or drink contains water. In fact, our bodies are composed of up to 70% water. Water is life. </p>
